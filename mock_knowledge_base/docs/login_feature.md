# Login Feature Documentation

This document describes the user login flow and implementation details.

## Overview

The login feature provides secure user authentication for the NexusAI platform. It supports both desktop and mobile interfaces with responsive design considerations.

## UI Elements

- **Username field**: Text input for user identification
- **Password field**: Secure password input with visibility toggle
- **Login Button**: Primary action button (See ui_guidelines.md for styling)
- **Remember Me**: Optional checkbox for session persistence
- **Forgot Password**: Link to password recovery flow

## Authentication Flow

1. User enters credentials
2. Client-side validation
3. Secure transmission to authentication service
4. Token generation and storage
5. Redirect to dashboard

## Known Issues

- **NEX-123**: Alignment on mobile devices (screens < 480px)
  - Status: Fixed in commit_abc123
  - Solution: Centered button with auto margins

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- HTTPS required for all authentication endpoints
- Session tokens expire after 24 hours
- Rate limiting applied to prevent brute force attacks

## Mobile Responsiveness

The login form adapts to different screen sizes:
- Desktop: Standard two-column layout
- Tablet: Single column with increased spacing
- Mobile: Compact layout with touch-friendly controls

## Testing

- Unit tests cover validation logic
- Integration tests verify authentication flow
- Cross-browser compatibility tested on major browsers
- Mobile testing on iOS and Android devices
